# Reddit comment prediciton
Welcome to our Reddit Comment Prediction project. This project is part of the Natural Language Processing course at DKE Maastricht University. 
The project aims to understand how reddit comments get down- or upvoted and how we can teach a neural network to predict this based on the text of a comment.
